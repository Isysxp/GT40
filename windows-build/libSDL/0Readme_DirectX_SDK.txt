The Microsoft DirectX SDL can be freely downloaded from:

    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812

The SDL contains many components which add up to consume about 1.1GB of storage.  
You may install the complete Microsoft supplied version, or you can merely use 
the single library file included here which must be present when applications 
are statically linked with LibSDL.

The necessary file is:

        windows-build\libSDL\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\Lib\x86\dxguid.lib
